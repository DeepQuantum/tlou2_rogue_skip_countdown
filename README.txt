This mod allows you to press 'P' to skip the timers in No Return, e.g. "Wave Incoming" or "Returning To Hideout" countdowns in any game mode. This mod should fully work with custom length timers in a custom run.

======== INSTALLATION ========

This mod requires the ndmodloader.

Simply put the "skip_timers_rogue.psarc" file from the .zip archive in your mods folder.

======== NOTES ========

This mod edits quite a bit of code from the scripts to make skipping possible. If you encounter any bugs, please let me know immediately. Make sure to include your game mode and which timer broke. The more detailed you are, the easier it will be for me to fix the issue.


======== CHANGELOG ========

* 1.1.0 | Temporarily removed Holdout because the newest game version completely changed this script, needing a rewrite for the mod
* 1.0.0 | Release

======== SPECIAL THANKS ========
