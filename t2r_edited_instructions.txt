main: 5850
5840: 15 -> 00
0x000060D0: 15 -> 00
0x00003EA8: 15 -> 00

1A20 is the location of the pointer of the pointer to the first lambda in the #29 event
i need to change the value at 1A20 to the location of the pointer to the dead lambda

so 1A20 becomes 2A88, because thats the location of the pointer to the dead code


* find instruction pointer of lambda you want to redirect (in my case lambda 1 in event #297F120B64AEE026 in ss-w-t2r, so address 3EA8)
* search for that pointer value, that location will have another pointer
* search for that pointer value, it'll have as many hits as there are (events/tracks?) that reference that lambda
* go to one of those locations and change the pointer to the lambda you got by doing the same process as above but with the lambda you want to point to

so in my case:
* current lambda start -> 3ea8
* search for 3ea8 -> pointer 21f0
* search for 21f0 -> locations 1908 and 1a20
* trial/error find that 1a20 is the lambda i want to change
* go to lambda you want to redirect to, in my case 5A48
* search for 5A48 -> location 2a88
* replace value at 1a20 with 2a88
